# Tip-Calculator
Demo for CodePath iOS for Designers course. Currently built for an iPhone 6 running iOS 8.4

Time spent: 12–15 hours

• Make a Tip Calculator that lets you pick different percentages with swift a decimal pad keyboard. 
• Optional — Modified the Launcher Screen, colored the app,  modified the text  styles and colors. 
• Optional — Added animation on load of the app.

Other Notes — 

All together I would say I spent between 15 – 20 hours total on this. I made a couple different version for this demo. I have a 6 Plus running iOS 9 beta as my primary device. I wanted to make a version that was easier to test so I made the current version. I also added some easy animations with Meng To’s Spring library linked below.
